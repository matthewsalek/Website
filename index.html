                <p>As a kid and young adult, I loved to read books about science and engineering. It was difficult for me to choose only one area of engineering, which is why mechatronics was the best fit for me. I learn about computer, mechanical and electrical engineering, allowing me to be well rounded and be a valuable asset to any team, at any time. </p>

                <h4>Embedded Software Developer</h4>
                <p>Behold Control is a building automation company, making a smart thermostat for large buildings. I joined Behold as the first full time employee. In fact, my first day there was only one desk and one chair present in the entire office. It was fantastic experience, starting a product from essentially the ground up. I was given full freedom to direct how the product would be developed, how the embedded system would be designed, and what features would be most valuable for customers. I designed and developed all aspects of the controller, and worked on aspects such as the back end and front end of the web application, encryption and current sensors. By having so much to do in so little time at Behold, I gained valuable skills in project management, time management and communication. </p>

                <h4>Software Validation Engineer</h4>
                <p>At Evertz Microsystems I gained exposure to the film and broadcast industry. As a software validation engineer, I worked with many of the companies products, and interacted with many engineers. I learned from well experienced programmers, and gained insight as to how systems, servers and embedded systems are produced and managed. I heavily used linux and the terminal, and became comfortable with server configuration and common computer networking protocals.</p>

                <p>Mercator Robotec creates machine vision solutions for customers. At Mercator, I designed components for a robotic system, capable of detecting defects of needles commonly used in hospitals. I created exploded drawings of CAD components that were sent to a manufacturer. As well, I worked with the manufacturer in order to ensure the product was being properly developed. I gained valuable skills as to how machine systems are configured, and to how a robotic system is developed. </p>

                <h4>C</h4>
                <p>With this project I implemented a sorting implementation for a real time system. I used quicksort on an array given, and at small array sizes, switched the sorting alogirthm in order to increase the speed of the application. I created a new thread for the left and right hand of the pivot, and used semaphores in order to protect a critical region that involved incrementing and decremting a counter. I gained fundamental understanding of aspects of a real time system. </p>
